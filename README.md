# Design of 16-bit Ring Oscillator PUF and 7-Segment Display on FPGA
---
## Abstract
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Ring Oscillator Physical Unclonable Function (RO PUF) on FPGA hardware, with the output displayed on a seven-segment LED display. By exploiting the inherent randomness and process variations of each FPGA board, the system generates unique bitstreams derived from frequency differences between multiple ring oscillators (ranging from a few hertz to several tens of hertz). These bitstreams can then be stored in non-volatile memory for potential applications such as device authentication or data encryption. As this work represents an initial prototype, the design has not yet been optimized in terms of hardware resource utilization and processing speed.
